                <div class="section"># The problem</div>
                For a few days now, I've been setting up VMs for gmaing with PCI passthrough on my laptop. <br />
                They worked just fine with my monitor plugged in, but if I powered on the VM with a HDMI dummy plug in the card, it just stopped working. <br />
                Even if I plugged my monitor in, if the card had the plug during boot, it just didn't work. <br />
                If, however I booted the VM first, then once fully powered, plugged in the dummy plug, it worked just fine. <br />
                <br />

                <div class="section"># What does such a plug even do?</div>
                So, to figure out where the problem lies, I started by looking up what an HDMI dumym plug even does. <br />
                Apparently it fakes a monitor output by providing the card with EDID (Extended Display Identification Data). It's a protocol that allows the monitor to tell the output device what resoultions, framerates and other stuff it supports. <br />
                <br />

                <div class="section"># The solution</div>
                Using the i2c interface of the GPU, I read the EDID information of my real monitor and then wrote it to the dummy plug. <br />
                Yes, that's it. The card now boots up just fine. <br />
                <br />

                <div class="section"># How to do it</div>
                I wouldn't really recommend overwriting any EDID data, if you're not sure it's needed. <br />
                With that out of the way, the procedure is quite simple really. All you need is i2c-tools. <br />
                First you need to find out which i2c bus is the card, then you read/write to the 0x50 chip

                . <br />
                I wrote a tool to automate the reading/writing part, but I don't guarantee it's 100% safe. <br />
                <br />

                <div class="section"># Possible causes</div>
                The only possibility I have thought up is that the NVIDIA GPU check for something during the hardware initialization and either blacklists certain stuff or just crashes when it recieves information it didn't expect. <br />
